PER   O      O     ORG  ORG   O    O   O         LOC    LOC   EOS
```

#### Part-of-Speech (POS)

## Evolution of NLP and Sequence tagging 

### 1954-1966 - AI Over-optimism and AI Winter
::: incremental
- 1954: IBM-Georgetown machine translation: Sixty Russian sentences translated into English
- 1957: Noam Chomsky *Syntactic Structures*: 
  - *Generative Grammar*: A system of rules that generate exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences
  - *Anti-probabilistic*: "probabilistic models give no particular insight into some of the basic problems of syntactic structure."
:::

### 1954-1966 - AI Over-optimism and AI Winter
::: incremental
- 1958: H. A. Simon and Allen Newell:"within ten years a digital computer will discover and prove an important new mathematical theorem"
- 1960's: Slow progress in machine translation
- 1966: ALPAC report ledas to defunding of machine translation in US
- 1974â€“1980: Triggers First AI Winter
:::

### Late 1980's and 1990's - Rise Statistical Models
::: incremental
- Less dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics
- More computational power
- Availability of Annotated Datasets
- Give Rise to Statistical NLP
  - 1989: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for Speech
  - 1993: Penn Treebank Project
  - 1995: WordNet: A Lexical Database for English
  - 1996: A Maximum Entropy Model for Part-Of-Speech Tagging
  - 2001: Conditional Random Field
:::

### 2000's to 2010 - Neural Models and Word Embeddings

- Neural net and LSTM revolution

### 2010 to Today - Transformers

- First gen Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, Electra)
- LLM's. (GPT-2, GPT-3, Claude, LLaMA) [Stanford 2024 - Transformers Slide 9][14]
