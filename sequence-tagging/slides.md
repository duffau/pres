## Evolution of NLP and Sequence tagging 

### 1954-1966 - AI Over-optimism and AI Winter
::: incremental
- 1954: IBM-Georgetown machine translation: Sixty Russian sentences translated into English
- 1957: Noam Chomsky *Syntactic Structures*: 
  - *Generative Grammar*: A system of rules that generate exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences
  - *Anti-probabilistic*: "probabilistic models give no particular insight into some of the basic problems of syntactic structure."

### NER Tagging Approaches

## CRF Training Demo

```python
import sklearn_crfsuite

def word2features(tokens, i):
    features = {
      "bias": 1.0,
      "word": tokens[i].lower(),
      "prev_word": tokens[i-1],
      "next_word": tokens[i+1],
      "shape": re.sub("X", "\d", word)
    }
    return features
```

---

```python
import datasets

def load_X_y(dataset_id="eriktks/conll2003", split="train"):
    data = datasets.load_dataset(dataset_id)
    sentences = data[split]["tokens"]
    labels = data[split]["ner_tags"]
    label_names = data[split].features["ner_tags"].feature.names

    X, y = [], []
    for (sentence, label_seq), i in enumerate(sentences, labels):
      X.append(word2features(tokens, i)) 
      y.append([label_names[label_id] in label_seq])
    return X, y
```

```python
import sklearn_crfsuite
from sklearn_crfsuite import metrics

X, y = load_X_y(split="train")
crf = sklearn_crfsuite.CRF(
  algorithm='lbfgs',
  c1=0.5, 
  c2=0.01,
)
crf.fit(X, y)

X_test, y_test = load_X_y(split="test")
y_pred = crf.predict(X_test)

print(metrics.flat_classification_report(
    y_test, y_pred, labels=sorted_labels, digits=3
))

### Typical features

- `word`: one-hot encoding of current word
- `+1:word`: one-hot encoding of next word
- `word length`
- `word shape`:  `$1,230` -> `$x,xxx`
- `word.isupper()`
- POS tag
- Adjacent bi-grams adn tri-grams
- Windows of words
- Gazetteers

## CRF Theory
### Conditional Random Field model - Quick overview

![](static/hmm-memm-crf-diagrams.png){width=40%}

::: incremental
- Discriminative as opposed to Generative
- Bidirectional influence from labels
- Richer Word Feature transformations
- Non-independent features
- Solves the "label bias" issue of MEMM
:::

::: notes

- Relaxed sequential Markov assumption
  - Bidirectional influence from labels 
- Relax the "tag generates word" assumption
  - Allows rich word transformations
- Flexible influence from feature on
- Relaxed Independence Assumptions
  - Non-independent features of the entire observation sequence

. Label Bias
  - MEMM are logistic regression for each state transition given it's current state
  - State transition with high probability concentration
  - Leads to little influence from x-features
  - CRF solves by normalizing over transitions over the whole sequence rather than each step

:::

### Discriminative VS Generative Models

### Encoding condition dependence as Graphs 

$$
\{X_1, X_2, X_3\}
$$

### CRF probabilistic model

### CRF log-linear parametrization

### Fitting CRF's

- How to include "high cardinality" features like current `word`

$$ \ell(\theta) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log p\left(\mathbf{y}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_t ; \theta\right)
+ c_1 \lVert \theta \rVert_1 + c_2 \lVert \theta \rVert_2 $$

- Use of Orthant-Wise Limited-memory Quasi-Newton (OWL-QN) [@andrew2007scalable]
- Convex Optimization Problem

> The Company â€™ s revenue by major product and service line for the three and nine months ended September 30 was as follows : ( a ) Includes $ [4.0]B-Revenues million and $ [3.0]B-Revenues million of VAPS service revenue for the three months ended September 30 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively , and $ [11.9]B-Revenues million and $ [7.9]B-Revenues million of VAPS service revenue for the nine months ended September 30 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively .

### Inference in CRF

![](static/trellis.png){width=40%}

- Naive implementation: $O(2^n)$

### Inference in Transformers

### Speed benchmarks 


| Model | Time per token |
|:-------|--------:|  
| CRF   |              x |        
| BERT  |              y |
| LSTM  |              z |

### Conclusion

- CRF's are great at identifying entities which are identified by syntactic and some extent semantic information
- Quadratic transformers are MUCH MUCH slower, Sub-quadratic transformers are also MUCH slower. The constant in front of n actually matters!
