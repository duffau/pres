## Evolution of NLP and Sequence tagging 

### 1954-1966 - AI Over-optimism and AI Winter
::: incremental
- 1954: IBM-Georgetown machine translation: Sixty Russian sentences translated into English
- 1957: Noam Chomsky *Syntactic Structures*: 
  - *Generative Grammar*: A system of rules that generate exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences
  - *Anti-probabilistic*: "probabilistic models give no particular insight into some of the basic problems of syntactic structure."

### NER Tagging Approaches



## CRF Theory
### Conditional Random Field model - Quick overview

![](hmm-memm-crf-diagrams.png)

- Discriminiative as opposed to Generative
- Allows bidirectional influence from labels
- Allows feature influence from any time step

### CRF Training Demo

```python
import sklearn_crfsuite

def word2features(tokens, i):
    features = {
      "bias": 1.0,
      "word": tokens[i].lower(),
      "prev_word" = tokens[i-1],
      "next_word" = tokens[i+1],
      "shape": re.sub(word, "\d")
    }
    return features
```

### CRF Training Demo

```python
import sklearn_crfsuite

def sent2features(tokens):
    return [word2features(tokens, i) for i in range(len(tokens))]

X = [sent2features(tokens) for tokens in sentences]
y = <labels>

crf = sklearn_crfsuite.CRF(algorithm='lbfgs')
crf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
### Typical features

- `word` one-hot

### Discriminative VS Generative Models

### Encoding condition dependence as Graphs 

$$
\{X_1, X_2, X_3\}
$$

### CRF probabilistic model

### CRF log-linear parametrization

### Fitting CRF's

- How to include "high cardinality" features like current `word`

$$ \ell(\theta) = \sum_{t=1}^{N} \log p\left(\mathbf{y}_t} \mid \mathbf{x}_t} ; \theta\right)
+ c_1 \lVert \theta \rVert + c_2 \lVert \theta \rVert_2 $$

- Convex Optimization Problem -> Unique Solution
- Use of Orthant-Wise Limited-memory Quasi-Newton (OWL-QN) [@andrew2007scalable]
 

## Performance comparison

### FinNER-139

> The Company â€™ s revenue by major product and service line for the three and nine months ended September 30 was as follows : ( a ) Includes $ [4.0]B-Revenues million and $ [3.0]B-Revenues million of VAPS service revenue for the three months ended September 30 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively , and $ [11.9]B-Revenues million and $ [7.9]B-Revenues million of VAPS service revenue for the nine months ended September 30 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively .


## Speed comparison

### Big-O reminder

<div class="callout callout-blue">
  <h4 >Definition </h4>
  $f(n) = O(n)$
  $\\[10pt]$
  $\text{if} \quad f(n) \leq C\cdot n \qquad \text{for all} \quad n>n_0.$
</div>

### Inference in CRF

![](static/trellis.png){width=40%}

- Naive implementation: $O(2^n)$

### Inference in Transformers

### Speed benchmarks 


| Model | Time per token |
|:-------|--------:|  
| CRF   |              x |        
| BERT  |              y |
| LSTM  |              z |

### Conclusion

- CRF's are great at identifying entities which are identified by syntactic and some extent semantic information
- Quadratic transformers are MUCH MUCH slower, Sub-quadratic transformers are also MUCH slower. The constant in front of n actually matters!
