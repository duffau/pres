- Intuitive connection between CRF graph and equation
  - Alternative motivate through softmax regression (Larochelle)
- Inference in CRF: Explain Viterbi decoding
- Inference in transformer: Explain self-attention
- Storyline and examples in accuracy benchmark
- Speed benchmark
- ~~Add feature importance to Python example~~
- ~~Add github link to Python demo~~
- ~~Fitting: Why does it work?~~
  - L2 makes it strictly convex -> hence unique solution (given reg constant)
  - L1 shrinks the parameter space
  - L-BFGS (Orthant-wise limited-memory quasi-Newton) converges fast
